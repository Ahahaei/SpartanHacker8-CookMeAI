                <p class="m-0">Welcome to our cuisine website! This website is a project we made for the Spartan Hack 8 that includes multiple features to give users( especially MSU students) a convenient experience. We are excited to share with you our newest features: Img2Ing, Eat2gether and food/hall reviews from MSU.</p>

                        <p>Img2Ing is an AI bot that takes food images as an input and it would give you the ingredients and how to cook for it.
                            This AI model is still in our developing stages as it still gives out relatively true outputs, but sometimes it gives unexpected output.</p>

                        <p>Eat2Gether is a feature we integrated in the website for MSU students and also everyone. Assuming you have a group of 4s, just like our spartan Hack team, and you want to meet up and eat together, this feature will calculate and give out the dining places in the middle.</p>

                        <p>Our first attempt for this website was just simply making a blog with foods and also hall reviews for new MSU students to read. After several ideal exchanges, we decided to add more features and change everything, but we still keep this feature as our team loves to write blogs.</p>
